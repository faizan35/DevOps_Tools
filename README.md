==================

this the tools tom picked who wants to be a devops engineer

---

tom  wants to become devops engineer in less time which tools he should focus more and which tools to focus less , so that he dosent waste time in some tool that is less used.
---
### Focus More:
1. Git: Essential for version control. It's practically a must-know for any DevOps engineer.
2. Jenkins: A popular CI/CD tool with a large user base. Understanding its ins and outs
will be valuable.
3. Docker: Containerization is a fundamental concept, and Docker is widely adopted in
the industry.
4. Kubernetes: As container orchestration is becoming standard, Kubernetes skills are
highly sought after.
5. Terraform: laC is crucial, and Terraform is widely used for provisioning and managing
infrastructure.
6. Prometheus and Grafana: Monitoring is a key aspect of DevOps, and these tools are
frequently used together for effective monitoring and visualization.


### Focus Less (But Still Good to Know):
1. Ansible: While valuable for configuration management, it might be good for Tom to
have a basic understanding but not necessarily dive too deep initially.
2. Slack: It's widely used, but mastering it doesn't take as much time as some other
tools. Basic proficiency should be enough initially.
3. GitHub: Tom can focus on understanding the basics of Git and version control, and
later explore more advanced GitHub features.
4. JFrog Artifactory: Important for artifact management, but Tom might not need an in-
depth knowledge initially.
5. Selenium: It's crucial for automated testing, but Tom can start with the basics and
then delve deeper as needed.
