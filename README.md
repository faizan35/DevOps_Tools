# DevOps Tools

A repository providing an overview of popular DevOps concepts and tools categorized for different stages of the software development lifecycle.

## Concepts

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

- Automating the code integration process to identify and fix issues early.

### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)

- Extending CI by automating the deployment process, ensuring code is always in a deployable state.

### 3. Continuous Deployment

- Automatically deploying code changes to production after passing automated tests.

### 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

- Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code for consistency and versioning.

### 5. Microservices Architecture

- Designing applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.

### 6. Containerization

- Using containers (e.g., Docker) to package and run applications consistently across different environments.

### 7. Orchestration

- Managing and coordinating multiple containers in complex applications (e.g., Kubernetes).

### 8. Version Control

- Using tools like Git to manage and track changes in the codebase.

### 9. Monitoring and Logging

- Implementing tools for real-time monitoring, error tracking, and logging (e.g., Prometheus, ELK stack).

### 10. Collaboration and Communication

- Emphasizing communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.

### Focus More:

1. Git: Essential for version control. It's practically a must-know for any DevOps engineer.
2. Jenkins: A popular CI/CD tool with a large user base. Understanding its ins and outs
   will be valuable.
3. Docker: Containerization is a fundamental concept, and Docker is widely adopted in
   the industry.
4. Kubernetes: As container orchestration is becoming standard, Kubernetes skills are
   highly sought after.
5. Terraform: laC is crucial, and Terraform is widely used for provisioning and managing
   infrastructure.
6. Prometheus and Grafana: Monitoring is a key aspect of DevOps, and these tools are
   frequently used together for effective monitoring and visualization.

### Focus Less (But Still Good to Know):

1. Ansible: While valuable for configuration management, it might be good for Tom to
   have a basic understanding but not necessarily dive too deep initially.
2. Slack: It's widely used, but mastering it doesn't take as much time as some other
   tools. Basic proficiency should be enough initially.
3. GitHub: Tom can focus on understanding the basics of Git and version control, and
   later explore more advanced GitHub features.
4. JFrog Artifactory: Important for artifact management, but Tom might not need an in-
   depth knowledge initially.
5. Selenium: It's crucial for automated testing, but Tom can start with the basics and
   then delve deeper as needed.
